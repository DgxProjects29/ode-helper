# ODE HELPER

a project created to help me to solve differential equations and related topics.

the program solves the equation in steps and uses Wolfram|Alpha for solving repetitive problems such as integrals and derivatives.

the code has been tested in a few scenarios and may not work, besides the way of solving the ode is tied to my university.

### Dependencies

The only dependency is selenium 3.141.0

### How to use

the documentation of the available commands is inside of request_proccesor file

```
python ode3.py <request> <arg1> <arg2> <argn>.....
